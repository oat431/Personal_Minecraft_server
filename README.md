Saving memory with my friend, I guess?

## Guide if you want to open the server yourself

1. pick your server (VM mostly) and choose about 4 to 8 Gbs Ram server

3. set up network security by adding port 25565 (Minecraft server default port)

2. remote to the VM and install java (recommend JDK 16)

3. clone this repo

4. change the directory to the repo and run the command "java -jar paper.jar --nogui."

5. give public IPv4 to your friend

6. you are now good to go

my personal recommendation is Azure Virtual machine 8 Gbs and picks the nearest region of you (I choose Singapore)
