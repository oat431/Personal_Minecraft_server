Saving memory with my friend I guess?

## Guide if you want to open the server yourself

1. pick your server (VM mostly) and choose about 4 to 8 Gbs Ram server

3. set up network security by adding port 25565 (minecraft server default port)

2. remote to the VM and install java (JDK 11 or greater version)

3. clone this repo

4. change directory to the repo and run command "java -jar paper.jar --nogui"

5. give public IPv4 to your friend

6. you are now good to go

my personal recommand is Azure Virtual machine 8 Gbs and pick the nearest region of you (I choose Singapo)
