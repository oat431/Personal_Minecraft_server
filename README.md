Saving memory with my friend I guess?

## Guide if you want to open the server yourself

1. pick your server (VM mostly) and choose about 4 to 8 Gbs Ram server

3. set up network security by adding port 25565 (minecraft server default port)

2. remote to the VM and install java (JDK 1.8++)

3. clone this repo

4. change directory to the repo and run command "java -jar spigot.jar --nogui"

5. give public IPv4 to your friend

6. you are now good to go

my personal recommand is Azure Virtual machine 8 Gbs
